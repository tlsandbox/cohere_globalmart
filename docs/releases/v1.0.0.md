# v2.0.0 - GlobalMart Fashion Cohere Migration

## Highlights

- Rebranded the application from RetailNext to GlobalMart Fashion.
- Replaced OpenAI-powered paths with Cohere-powered paths:
  - Text retrieval ranking uses Cohere rerank.
  - Image analysis uses Cohere vision.
  - Match judgement augmentation uses Cohere chat.
- Added configurable Cohere settings:
  - `COHERE_API_KEY`
  - `COHERE_API_BASE_URL`
  - `RN_CHAT_MODEL`
  - `RN_VISION_MODEL`
  - `RN_RERANK_MODEL`
- Updated local port policy to `8005..8009` with bounded auto-selection.

## Operational Notes

- If Cohere is unavailable, the service degrades gracefully to deterministic/lexical fallback where possible.
- Voice transcription endpoint remains present but intentionally reports unsupported in this Cohere build.
